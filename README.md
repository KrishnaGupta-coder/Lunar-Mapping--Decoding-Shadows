# 🌕 Decoding Shadows: AI-Driven Lunar Terrain Mapping for Safer Space Missions 🚀

> A next-gen solution to reconstruct high-resolution **Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)** from single lunar images using a fusion of **Shape-from-Shading (SfS)** and **deep learning**. Designed for ISRO, students, and future space explorers alike.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Lunar navigation is dangerous—especially in shadowed, crater-rich terrains. Traditional DEMs lack detail, especially in high-relief or low-light areas.

**Our Mission:**  
Build an AI-first system that decodes deceptive shadows in OHRC lunar images to generate elevation maps, detect terrain hazards (boulders, landslides), and empower safe landings and autonomous rovers.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Current lunar DEMs from altimeters or stereo imaging are expensive, low-resolution, and fail in shadowed regions.  
**Photoclinometry (SfS)** gives a breakthrough, but it's limited by physics assumptions.

### 🔍 What we solve:

- Missing elevation in shadowed/complex terrains
- High-cost hardware dependency
- Static, non-interactive maps
- Lack of integrated hazard detection (e.g. boulders, craters)
